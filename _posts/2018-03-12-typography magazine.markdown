Magazine for Bangkok tourism
We had to choose a destination and make two layouts- one layout with grid and one breaking the grid. It had to look aesthetically pleasing with correct font size and all specifications of typography had to be met. I tried looking at magazine layouts from a different aspects and tried bringing the essence of Bangkok and its culture through the layout, font style and pictures.
