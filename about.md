I am Hasika Tejwani, a 19 year old, first year undergraduate student at NMIMS School of Design.
Design is a completely unique profession that many people aren't even aware about. I always felt that the experiences of your life teaches you much more than textbooks theory, and this course of Bachelors of Design at NMIMS focuses only on experience based learning. In this blog, I write about how different experiences help me make different kinds of designs at this school. Hope you like it!
