I am Hasika Tejwani, a 19 year old, first year undergraduate student at NMIMS School of Design.
Design is a completely unique profession that many people aren't even aware about. I have never been able to remember the theory based learning from textbooks that we have had since childhood. I always felt that the experiences of your life teach you much more than textbooks and this course of Bachelors of Design at NMIMS focuses only on experience based learning. In this blog, I write about how different experiences help me make different types of designs at this school. Hope you like it!
